# React-Employee-Directory

![Project license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

The goal was to create an employee directory using React.js. This involved breaking up your application's UI into components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

## Usage
```
Technologies Used:
React.js - ReactDOM.render - components - state - props - classes - hooks - axios - Random Users API
```
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
